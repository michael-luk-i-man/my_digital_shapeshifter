Occupy time thinking about <b>general intelligence, engineering, efficiency, physics, and the distribution of nuanced experiences across the globe and how not to forget them. </b>On a mission to hard-approximate what we are in context of reality without getting lost. I have some ideas. Stoicism with the windows rolled down. Seemingly unachievable things are possible if we just start and keep going. Like myself a good ol’ slice of pizza, although could vibe with quinoa if there was enough of it in a bowl. Borscht is also pretty good but you wouldn’t expect it to be.</p><p class="qtext_para">I hold a neuroscience degree and am entering an advanced study in computer science at the Courant Institute in New York. At heart, I’m driven by the thought of making the most of our time here, both for future populations and our own experience. Not to mention, it makes me happy every day. I just began posting on Quora so follow if you want to help me stimulate more exciting conversation.</p><p class="qtext_para"><b>Running, biking, and hiking in different countries is cool.</b> Abstract things are cool. Physical things have some cool abstract things embedded inside. I’ve met some of the best friends in the world. I have participated in the Samsung Tel Aviv Marathon (2016) and Shanghai Spartan Race (2017). 1995 was the year the modern internet began. I began prematurely the same year. One year, I might die. Now, I’m off to make the best of it all things considered.</p><p class="qtext_para">Like how the sun is both calm and terrible, indifferent power and accuracy is mandatory.</p><ul><li>Founding Member of <span class="qlink_container"><a href="http://2014.hackshanghai.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);" class="external_link" data-qt-tooltip="hackshanghai.com">HackShanghai - China&#039;s Largest College Hackathon</a></span>.</li><li>Lead Engineer of SpaceX’s上海perloop, Founding Project Lead at 2016 Design Weekend (<span class="qlink_container"><a href="http://www.hyperloopshanghai.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);" class="external_link" data-qt-tooltip="hyperloopshanghai.com">Home</a></span>).
