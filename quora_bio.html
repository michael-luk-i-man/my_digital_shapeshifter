*Kenny Song* (http://kennysong.com/)* and I in the reflection of a window of the Trans-Siberian Railway.*
Are we the aggregate of who we surround ourselves with? Here’s a list from home, of those I used to play Runescape with in the early mornings and more:
My friend Dolan is a lifeguard, collecting many tattoos.

My friend Smallberg is in the US Navy, recently ran a hundred kilometer marathon.

My friend John graduated from Stanford but I think almost failed his physics class, lives in Silicon Valley.

My friend Chzchan studies economics, a renewable energy fan.

My friend Brando is an electrical engineer, worked in a warehouse.

My friend Joe is returning to college, graduated highschool at home.

My friend Bergman works at the LEGO store, was with me when I failed my highschool water polo tryouts.

My sister is an actress and producer of theatre, dance, and shortfilms, lives in Hollywood.

My other friends are designers, writers, cooks, and the most important part of childhood.

My parents have my love.
As it seems, it’s a pretty close-knit group. Here’s a clip of some those friends above, many years ago at a LAN party (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAN_party) playing a well-seasoned game, *Age of Empires II*, with a bug that prevented the game from starting:

Reading on if you’re curious, I’m American born but Indonesian-raised, from Southern California’s Los Angeles county area.
I lived in China for my undergraduate career, also living in Argentina and Israel during some of that time. I hold both a US and Chinese neuroscience degree from New York University’s Shanghai campus, the First Independent Sino-US joint venture in history, as part of its first graduating class.
\\ ’17. B. Sci. Neural Science.
In computer science, there is a popular structure modeled after findings in neural science called *convolutional neural networks* (CNNs), important in things such as computer vision. The founder of CNNs is also Facebook’s *Director of Artificial Intelligence*, Yann LeCun, who is a faculty member at the *Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences* in New York (#1 program via Applied Mathematics (http:// https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/applied-mathematics-rankings) in the world). I am pursuing a graduate degree of Computer Science here, following up on my neuroscience studies and lucky to even be considered coming from a different field.
\\ ’19. M. Sci. Computer Science.
I’m a boy who never imagined to go on the adventures he’s created around the globe. I don’t come from a high income family so the scholarship I received in college was my shot at traveling the world, something many people hope to save up for in retirement - I took it.

*Istanbul, Turkey with דוד, Izu, and Darsh.*
I occupy my time thinking about **general intelligence, engineering, efficiency, physics, and the distribution of nuanced experiences across the globe and how not to forget them, and food. **I’m on a mission to hard-approximate what we are in context of reality without getting lost. I support stoicism “with the windows rolled down”. Seemingly unachievable things are possible if we just start and keep going.
At heart, I’m driven by the thought of making the most of our time here, both for future populations and our own experiences. Not to mention, it makes me happy every day doing what I do. I just began posting on Quora so follow if you want to help me stimulate more exciting conversations.
I like myself a good ol’ slice of pizza, although could vibe with quinoa if there was enough of it in a bowl. Borscht is also pretty good but you wouldn’t expect it to be. I’m currently working in a delicious, caring, and modern noodle place called The Tang at 120 1st Ave in Manhattan. I really love the food there - you might too. If you want, ask for me and come say hi!

*Me eating seemingly healthy food in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.*
**Running, biking, and hiking in different countries is cool.** Abstract things are cool. Physical things have some cool abstract things embedded inside.
I’ve met some of the best friends in the world. I have participated in the Samsung Tel Aviv Marathon (2016) and Shanghai Spartan Race (2017). 1995 was the year the modern internet began. I began prematurely the same year. One year, I might die. Now, I’m off to make the best of it all things considered.
Like how the sun is both calm and terrible, indifferent power and accuracy is mandatory.
* Founding Member of HackShanghai - China's Largest College Hackathon (http://2014.hackshanghai.com).
* Lead Engineer of SpaceX’s上海perloop, Founding Project Lead at 2016 Design Weekend (Home (http://www.hyperloopshanghai.com/)). Currently brilliantly run by Bradford Sunderland et al.
* Lab Rat at The Erlich Lab (https://www.erlichlab.org/), the lab’s first undergraduate. Project in economic decision making, stress, HRL, a top-down analysis in a lab built from the bottom-up. PI: Jeffrey Erlich, PhD, alumni of Princeton Brody Lab.
* First undergrad at Israel Brain Technologies http://israelbrain.org/ (http://israelbrain.org/). The most prominent neuroscience accelerator in the “Startup Nation”.
I’m not going to put my website here. I don’t have a GitHub for you. I’m just a spicy boi.

*Standing en route into the expanse of the largest lake in the world, Lake Baikal in Russia.*
I don’t know how much I know of what there exists to know, but I’ve made it a point to explore what many people may already think they know, such as the giants of China, Russia, and the Middle East, of which we all could explore a bit more for what they are. Some things are right and some things are wrong about the different global conceptions. I got into neuroscience so I could explain and help some of the things humans go through on a rigorous level. I entered computer science to incorporate the practical thinking and riveting calculations that thread our world together. My moonshot is to conceivably plan a journey to map out the brain before the end of our lifetimes - and I believe bigger moonshots have been made which have come true. So that’s where I am at. Along the way, I treat Quora as a journal of sorts, a solidifying of ideas (which can deceptively seem concrete in the mind until you have to explain them).
In that way, Quora allows me to practice my ability to explain things and actually reach people (at this point, 150 thousand+ views). It tests my knowledge and what I can offer off the top of my head. It’s a way to keep an idea diary that has byproducts of helping people, in any capacity. At first, questions took me a couple hours to write; in Shanghai, I kept editing until postmidnight - now I try to fit an answer every time I take the subway between Brooklyn and Manhattan.
So, here are some answers that can reveal a thread about how Quora’s algorithm serves content to me:
**The Brain (you have one behind the eyes reading this, and the more you know about it, the more likely you are to get it to do what you want)**
With my neuroscience degree, I want to offer what I can. There are some people that take some more time than others to understand a concept, so I answered the question Why are some people smart, but others aren’t (brain chemistry-wise)? (https://www.quora.com/Why-are-some-people-smart-but-others-aren’t-brain-chemistry-wise).
I reveal that the brain can be trained, following up with How do I train my subconscious brain? (https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-train-my-subconscious-brain). We get a bit more detailed in What is the algorithm of the human brain? (https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-algorithm-of-the-human-brain) and Is the brain a discrete or continuous information processing entity? (https://www.quora.com/Is-the-brain-a-discrete-or-continuous-information-processing-entity), entertaining the physical processes of the mind.
By then I managed to write an essay worth of content, as this bio intentionally is, which can be overwhelming for some. Thus prompting: How can one train their brain to work effectively for longer periods? (https://www.quora.com/How-can-one-train-their-brain-to-work-effectively-for-longer-periods)
Once you can buckle down and really work for dozens of hours, maybe we can start to make use of the approaches in: Where and how did you learn about AI, and what is your advice for beginners? (https://www.quora.com/Where-and-how-did-you-learn-about-AI-and-what-is-your-advice-for-beginners) If you forget many things while in the process learning, you may wonder How do I increase the memory power for conscious and unconscious events in the human brain? (https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-increase-the-memory-power-for-conscious-and-unconscious-events-in-the-human-brain)
However, it’s not all about raw memory and dry skills: we’ve got to focus on emotion and empathy, such as in As the brain isn't fully developed before around 25, can a teenager reduce their empathy and more or less shape how they think/how their brains work intentionally? (https://www.quora.com/As-the-brain-isnt-fully-developed-before-around-25-can-a-teenager-reduce-their-empathy-and-more-or-less-shape-how-they-think-how-their-brains-work-intentionally). If you find yourself getting a bit red in the face, you may find relevance in Why does a human's brain work in a different way when they have a crush? (https://www.quora.com/Why-does-a-humans-brain-work-in-a-different-way-when-they-have-a-crush)
It gets a bit dark, and if you’re fine with that then check out Is it normal that at a point of your life, (in your early 20s) you start liking to be alone, even if you always were a very sociable and outgoing person? I think I'm turning into an introvert, I hardly find people real and honest. (https://www.quora.com/Is-it-normal-that-at-a-point-of-your-life-in-your-early-20s-you-start-liking-to-be-alone-even-if-you-always-were-a-very-sociable-and-outgoing-person-I-think-Im-turning-into-an-introvert-I-hardly-find-people-real-and-honest) and If you were given your death date the moment you were born, would you have lived your life any differently? (https://www.quora.com/If-you-were-given-your-death-date-the-moment-you-were-born-would-you-have-lived-your-life-any-differently)

More abstract:
Matter is made of particles and particles are vibrations of a field. So what are fields? Is it something that just is and is itself an uncaused thing? (https://www.quora.com/Matter-is-made-of-particles-and-particles-are-vibrations-of-a-field-So-what-are-fields-Is-it-something-that-just-is-and-is-itself-an-uncaused-thing)
